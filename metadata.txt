description=This plugin extends gdal rasterize command to burn values from non-numeric field.
version=0.1
author=Mathieu Chailloux
email=mathieu@chailloux.org

about=Conversion from vector to raster. This algorithm is a wrapper of gdal rasterize that allows to specify a non-numeric field.  Output raster values are automatically generated according to input field values. A temporary integer field is created and a new integer value is associated to each input unique value (from 1 to N with N = number of unique values). Such association is loaded is CSV file 'Association.csv'. Output data type is chosen according to data range (unsigned integer type of minimal range, e.g. Byte, UInt16 or UInt32).
